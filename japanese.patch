+"Well done Hunter!\nNow that we have access to the makeshift camp we can finally see if the old radio station is still active.\nWe don't know the coordinates but I think it will be easy to find it on the map, it should be a paved area.\nAll I ask you to do is go there and see what the situation is like and report back, if you encounter any strange anomalies or mutants there is no need to engage in a fight.","Quest descriptions","1024","よくやったぞ、ハンター！\nこれで仮設キャンプに行けるようになったから、古いラジオ局がまだ使えるかどうかようやく確認できるぞ。\nあそこの座標まではわからないが、舗装された場所だからマップ上でも簡単に見つかるだろう。\n君にやってもらいことは、そこへ行って状況を確認することだ。そしてそれを報告してくれ。もし奇妙なアノマリーや突然変異体に遭遇しても、無駄な戦いをするな。"
+"From the helicopter's black box we were able to discover that the crew had spotted a strange purple crystal in the swamp.\nShortly thereafter, there appears to have been an unusual burst of radiation.\nThe crystal appears to be in the swamp village… There are good and bad news Hunter... The bad news is that there is a large amount of Ghouls in the village in the swamp, and I don't think you will make it alone.\nThe good one is that I contacted the Green Army, they are interested in cleaning up the village to get to the crystal.\nHere's the plan, Hunter.\nEntering the village with all those Ghouls would be a certain death sentence.\nThe village has only one entrance so you will try to lure them out with a very bright light, it will have to be done at night.\nGet into the swamp from 10pm to 3am, Green Army soldiers will be waiting for you.\nIt is advisable to bring an automatic weapon or a shotgun with a large magazine so that you have to reload as little as possible. Good luck Hunter!","Quest descriptions","1024","ヘリコプターのブラックボックスから、乗組員が沼地で奇妙な紫の結晶を発見していたことがわかった。\nその直後に異常な放射線が放出されたらしい。\nその結晶は沼地の村にあるようなんだが…、いいニュースと悪いニュースがある。悪い方のニュースは、そこには大量のグールがうろついていて、1人で行くのは無理だということ。\nいいニュースは、緑軍とコンタクトを取ったところ、結晶の確保のために村の掃討に手を貸してくれそうだということだ。\n計画はこうだ、ハンター。\nグールの村に足を踏み入れれば、それは確実に死を意味する。\n村には入口が1つしかない。そこで非常に明るい光を使ってグールをおびき出すようにする。それには夜行うしかないんだ。\n午後10時から午前3時までの間に沼地に行ってくれ。緑軍の兵士たちが待機している。\nリロードが最小限で済むよう、オートマチック系の武器か、マガジン容量の大きいショットガンを持っていくといい。グッドラック！"
+"Hey stranger! Welcome to the ZERO Sievert bunker.\nI don't know how you got here and frankly I don't care.\nIt's nothing personal, it's just that we see a lot of new faces here and only a few of them come back, so I won't waste my time remembering yours for now.\nFirst let's see what you can do...","Quest descriptions","1024","よう、新入り！バンカー「Zero　Sievert」へようこそ。\nどうやってここに来たかは知らないが、正直どうでもいい。\n気を悪くしないで欲しいんだが、毎回新しい顔をたくさん見てるが、戻ってくるのはそのうちの数人しかいない。だから君の顔を覚えてもどうせ時間の無駄だ。\nまずは実力を見せてもらおうか…"
 "Ah! As I thought...\nThe railroad was flooded by the Crimson Corporation.\nSmart move...\nThey used the old drainage system found in the sewers in the swamp.\nThey are easily visible on the minimap. What you have to do is go into the sewers and close the control valve. Good luck Hunter!","Quest descriptions","1024","やっぱり！思った通りだ...\n鉄道が水没したのはクリムゾン社の仕業だった。\n賢いな…\nやつらは沼地の下水道にあった古い排水システムを使ったんだ。\nそこはミニマップで簡単に確認できる。下水道に入って、制御バルブを閉めるんだ。幸運を祈る、ハンター！"
-"Very good Hunter! I didn't expect you to come back alive!\nI have another job for you.

 "Thanks to the radio tower, we intercepted conversations from the Crimson Corporation.\nIt seems that new agreements between them and the local government allow their presence in the bunker....\nHa! Unbelievable!\nI'd be really curious to know what Artemovich's face looked like when he heard about this, he did everything he could to keep them away from here and now he has to take them in.\nIt seems that the Crimson Corporation is coming with a ship and wants to dock at the port in the industrial zone.\nThe only hope Artemovich has is that they won't succeed, and I think that will be the case since the first Hunters reported a massive Ghoul presence in that area.\nNow it's up to you Hunter, if you want you can take care of the Ghouls and allow the Crimson Corporation to land and come to the bunker.\nYou will also have to place a GPS signal in the main dock, the one between the two abandoned ships.","Quest descriptions","1024","電波タワーのおかげで、クリムゾン社での会話を傍受できた。\nどうやらやつらは地元政府との間で新たな協定を結び、バンカーへの立ち入りが許可されたようだ…\nまったく、信じられん！\nこのことを聞いたらアルテモヴィッチはどんな顔をするだろう。やつらをここから遠ざけるためにあらゆる手を尽くしたのに、今は受け入れなきゃならないんだからな。\nクリムゾン社はどうやら船でやってきて、工業地区の港に停泊させたいらしい。\nアルテモヴィッチにとって唯一の望みは、それがうまくいかないことだ。すでに最初のハンターたちがあのエリアに大量のグールがいると報告してるから、きっと現実になるだろう。\nさあ、そこでこれは君次第なんだが、ハンター。もしよければ、グールの始末とクリムゾン社がうまく上陸してバンカーに到着できるように手伝ってくれないか？\nそれと、2隻の廃船の間にあるメインドックにGPSを設置するんだ。"
 "Great, Hunter!\nNow that we have access to the mall it's time to see what it looks like. You'll have to scout around and find the location of some stores.\nWhat do you say? Is this mission familiar to you?\nI don't understand how that could be possible.\nWhatever, back to us...
